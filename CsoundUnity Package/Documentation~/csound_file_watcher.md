## CsoundFileWatcher ##

From version 3.0 CsoundUnity can detect the changes made to the *csd* file while modifying it in an external editor.  
You will see in the Unity Console messages like this:

```
[CsoundFileWatcher] Updating csd: sfload.csd in GameObject: Csound
```

when this happens.
This means that you don't need to drag the Csd Asset in CsoundUnity everytime you make a change on it in an external editor.
